# Ghost Eye
Ghost Eye - Information Gathering Tool
<div>

**Ghost Eye** New Release. Ghost Eye is an Information Gathering, Footprinting, Scanner, and Recon Tool I made in Python 3. Since the last release of Ghost Eye, I've tweaked, removed, and added some new features. So that Ghost Eye would become more of a whole. For me, it remains a game of options so that together you get a complete overview of your target.
